Project Overview
==================

Goals
----------
The HART team's ultimate goal is to launch a rocket up to 150,000 feet above ground level. Any change to the system must be done with this goal in mind. As part of the Avionics-EECS subteam, our goal is to work on the rocket's avionics systems as well as any supporting systems that move us closer to our ultimate goal.

Basic Requirements
----------------------
The most basic requirements of a rocket avionics system are *triggering events* and *tracking the rocket*. Tracking the rocket will be how we determine if the rocket reached its goal altitude or not. There are several ways in which this step could go wrong or produce incorrect results, so redundancy and rigorous testing should be preferred. In addition to this, the rocket's avionics system must be able to trigger events under the right conditions in order to maximize the chances of reaching higher altitudes and, more importantly, the chances of successfully recovering the rocket.
